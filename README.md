# Analyzing Customer Segments with Python

## Background

In this analysis, we'll be working as a data analyst at a crowdfunding site. Our company is preparing for a marketing campaign in the next quarter, and the marketing manager is keen on targeting segments that have made significant donations in the past year. The task was to help the marketing manager prepare for an upcoming meeting with the CEO by creating a single visualization that addresses key questions about customer segments.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about customer contributions to different categories on the crowdfunding platform. It includes details such as the category, device type, age, gender, and the amount of donation.

## Visualization and Insights

### 1. Top Three Categories in Terms of Total Donations

The top three categories in terms of total donations are:

1. **Games**: ‚Ç¨16.54k
2. **Sports**: ‚Ç¨16.35k
3. **Technology**: ‚Ç¨16.27k

While the most common categories are Sports, Games, and Technology in terms of entries, the top three in terms of total donations are Games, Sports, and Technology. Categories like Environment and Fashion are also significant in terms of total donations.

### 2. Device Type with the Most Contributions

Historically, iOS devices have contributed significantly more than Android devices. Despite Android having 35% of the user count compared to iOS, the total amount donated by iOS users is nearly double that of Android users. The breakdown of contributions by gender and device type shows that iOS is slightly favored by females, while Android is slightly favored by males. The device type with the most contributions is **iOS**.

### 3. Target Age Bracket for the Campaign

Considering age and gender, the age bracket [18-24] stands out with the highest total amount of donations. This age bracket has a count of 10,439 users and a substantial total donation amount. While [25-34] and other age brackets are also contributors, the [18-24] age bracket is almost three times as significant in terms of total donations. A recommendation for the campaign's target age bracket would be **[18-24]**.
